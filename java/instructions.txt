Instructions
------------
The .class files that came with the repository may not work on your machine,
depending on the version you have. Below are instructions for compiling your
own .class files:

1. Compile Thyrosim.java and Getinit.java while including .jar file:
javac -classpath commons-math3-3.6.1.jar File.java

If the command javac is not found, you need to install a suitable JDK for your
distribution.

2. Put .class files in edu/ucla/distefanolab/thyrosim/algorithm/
